# lab-guidelines-template
A repository containing lab guidelines for project, data, and code management, including a template project. 

## Getting started
This repository contains two core directories:

1. `template`: A directory that can be used as a template for individual projects. All data, code, results, and writing are contained in one place.
2. `guidelines`: This includes helful guides from the British Ecological Society as well as a set of commandments developed by the Adler Lab at Utah State University to help catch mistakes before they happen. Also included is a style guide for writing R code. The style guide may seem arbitrary, but it helps us all write consistent code and makes it easier to catch mistakes as we review each others' code.
